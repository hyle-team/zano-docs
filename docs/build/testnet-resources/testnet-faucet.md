# Testnet faucet

Need testnet ZANO coins for development and testing? Use the official testnet faucet:

**[https://faucet.testnet.zano.org](https://faucet.testnet.zano.org)**

Enter your testnet wallet address to receive free testnet ZANO. These coins have no real value and are meant for testing purposes only.

## Getting a testnet wallet address

1. Download a [testnet build](./testnet-builds.md)
2. Launch the Zano application — it will automatically connect to the testnet network
3. Copy your wallet address from the application
4. Paste it into the faucet page and request coins
